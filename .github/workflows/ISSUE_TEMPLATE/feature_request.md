class SVMClassifier {
public:
    // Proposed new method
    NewFeatureResult new_feature_method(const torch::Tensor& input, 
                                       const FeatureParameters& params);
    
    // Or modifications to existing methods
    TrainingMetrics fit(const torch::Tensor& X, 
                       const torch::Tensor& y,
                       const NewOptions& options = {});
};
```
